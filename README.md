&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository is the code bin for the IC EDA Design Elite Challenge "Analysis and Evaluation of Dynamic Power Consumption Optimization Strategies for Digital Integrated Circuits" competition question. As one of the important metrics (PPA) to measure digital chip design, the analysis and optimization of low power consumption design is particularly important. This project is to implement a tool with VCD file signal flip count and flip rate statistics and GUI waveform display, and try to optimize its large file parsing and multi-core acceleration.
